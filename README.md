GETTING STARTED

This project contains many examples of Houdini & Houdini Engine related workflows and tools.

You can find Topics broken down into specific maps, found in the ContentExamples/Maps folder. 
Topics such as Geometry, Landscapes, Curves and more. 

When opening for the firs time, you may notice the maps have assets and text, but no working HDAs, 
this is because we need to cook these HDAs from scratch. 

To do this, fllow the steps below.

-

Step 1:
Have a version of Houdini Engine plugin installed in your project under
"(Your Project Path)/Plugins/Houdini Engine/"

Step 2:
Open the map of the topic you wish to explore.

Step 3:
In the top menu panel, under Houdini Engine, select "Create Session"

Step 4:
With a live session running, under the Houdini Engine panel, select "ReCook All"

Step 5:
Please see the example to the right, for a breakdown of our level layouts
