GETTING STARTED

This project contains many examples of Houdini & Houdini Engine related workflows and tools.

You can find Topics broken down into specific maps, found in the `Game/ContentExamples/Maps` folder. 

When opening for the first time, HDAs will need to be built. To do this, fllow the steps below.

-

Step 1:
Have a version of Houdini Engine plugin installed in your project under
"(Your Project Path)/Plugins/Houdini Engine/"

Step 2:
Open the map of the topic you wish to explore.

Step 3:
In the top menu panel, under `Houdini Engine`, select `Create Session`

Step 4:
With a live session running, under the `Houdini Engine` panel, select `ReCook All`
(Depending on PC performance, it may be better to build HDAs in sections, or one at a timme as you need)

Step 5:
Explore the Levels! Here is a rough guide on best way to explore.
 - Explore left to right for a progressive learning experience, but it is not required.
 - HDAs on the platform are live demos, and worth editing(see the front panel steps for more info)
 - Reading the backboard notes for extra info.
 - Open the HDAs in Houdini to explore the node network and seeing more comments.
